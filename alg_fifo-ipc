The provided code is a C program that simulates a simple disk scheduling algorithm to calculate the total head movement required to satisfy a sequence of disk requests. The program reads the number of requests, the sequence of disk requests, and the initial position of the disk head, then computes the total head movement using the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) algorithm.

Here is the detailed algorithm for this code:

Initialize Variables:

n: Integer to store the number of requests.
i: Loop counter.
RQ[100]: Array to store the request sequence (up to 100 requests).
initial: Integer to store the initial position of the disk head.
TotalHeadMoment: Integer to store the total head movement, initialized to 0.
Input the Number of Requests:

Print "no of req" to prompt the user.
Read the integer n from the user input.
Input the Request Sequence:

Print "enter req seq" to prompt the user.
Loop from i = 0 to i < n:
Read the next disk request and store it in RQ[i].
Input the Initial Position:

Print "initial" to prompt the user.
Read the integer initial from the user input.
Calculate Total Head Movement:

Loop from i = 1 to i < n:
Calculate the absolute difference between the current request (RQ[i]) and the initial position.
Add this difference to TotalHeadMoment.
Update initial to the current request (RQ[i]).
Output the Total Head Movement:

Print "Total Head Moment is" followed by the value of TotalHeadMoment.
Here is the detailed step-by-step algorithm:

Start
Initialize Variables:
Declare int n, i, RQ[100], initial, TotalHeadMoment = 0.
Prompt User for Number of Requests:
Print "no of req".
Read n.
Prompt User for Request Sequence:
Print "enter req seq".
For i from 0 to n-1:
Read RQ[i].
Prompt User for Initial Position:
Print "initial".
Read initial.
Calculate Total Head Movement:
For i from 1 to n-1:
Compute TotalHeadMoment = TotalHeadMoment + abs(RQ[i] - initial).
Update initial = RQ[i].
Print Result:
Print "Total Head Moment is" followed by TotalHeadMoment.

is this cscan code correct?
ChatGPT
The provided code for the C-SCAN disk scheduling algorithm has a small mistake in the implementation of the algorithm. It does not handle the wrap-around correctly when moving from the end of the disk to the beginning.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

c
Copy code
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int n, i, RQ[100], initial, disk_size, TotalHeadMovement = 0;
    printf("Number of requests: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    printf("Enter request sequence: ");
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &RQ[i]);
    }

    printf("Enter initial head position: ");
    scanf("%d", &initial);

    printf("Enter disk size: ");
    scanf("%d", &disk_size);

    // Sorting the request array using Bubble Sort
    for(i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        for(int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            if(RQ[j] > RQ[j + 1]) {
                int temp = RQ[j];
                RQ[j] = RQ[j + 1];
                RQ[j + 1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }

    int current_position = initial;

    // Moving towards the higher end of the disk
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if(RQ[i] >= initial) {
            TotalHeadMovement += abs(RQ[i] - current_position);
            current_position = RQ[i];
        }
    }

    // Move to the end of the disk
    if(current_position != disk_size - 1) {
        TotalHeadMovement += abs((disk_size - 1) - current_position);
        current_position = 0; // Jump to the beginning of the disk
        TotalHeadMovement += (disk_size - 1);
    }

    // Moving towards the lower end of the disk
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if(RQ[i] < initial) {
            TotalHeadMovement += abs(RQ[i] - current_position);
            current_position = RQ[i];
        }
    }

    printf("Total Head Movement is %d\n", TotalHeadMovement);
    return 0;
}
Explanation of Changes:
Sorting the Request Sequence:

Sorting the request sequence using Bubble Sort ensures that the requests are processed in ascending order.
Processing Requests in Ascending Order:

The first loop processes all requests that are greater than or equal to the initial head position, simulating the head moving towards the higher end of the disk.
Jumping to the Beginning of the Disk:

If the current head position is not at the end of the disk (disk_size - 1), the head moves to the end of the disk, and then jumps to the beginning (current_position = 0). The total head movement is incremented by the distance from the current position to the end of the disk, plus the size of the disk (since it wraps around).
Processing Remaining Requests:

The second loop processes all requests that are less than the initial head position, simulating the head moving from the beginning of the disk towards the initial position.
Verification:
To verify the code, you can test it with different input scenarios to ensure it correctly calculates the total head movement. For example:

Number of requests: 8
Request sequence: 95, 180, 34, 119, 11, 123, 62, 64
Initial head position: 50
Disk size: 200
The expected result can be calculated manually to confirm the correctness of the program.

The provided code is an implementation of the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) page replacement algorithm. The algorithm keeps track of the pages in memory and replaces the oldest page when a new page needs to be loaded and the memory is full.

Here's a detailed algorithm for the provided FIFO page replacement code:

Initialize Variables:

i, j, k: Loop counters.
f: Number of frames.
pf: Page fault counter, initialized to 0.
count: Counter to keep track of the next frame to replace, initialized to 0.
rs[25]: Array to store the reference string (maximum 25 references).
m[10]: Array to store the pages in memory (maximum 10 frames).
n: Length of the reference string.
Input the Length of the Reference String:

Print "Enter the length of reference string -- ".
Read the integer n from the user input.
Input the Reference String:

Print "Enter the reference string -- ".
Loop from i = 0 to i < n:
Read the next page reference and store it in rs[i].
Input the Number of Frames:

Print "Enter no. of frames -- ".
Read the integer f from the user input.
Initialize the Frames:

Loop from i = 0 to i < f:
Set m[i] to -1 (indicating an empty frame).
Print the Page Replacement Process Header:

Print "The Page Replacement Process is --".
Process Each Page Reference:

Loop from i = 0 to i < n:
Loop from k = 0 to k < f:
If m[k] is equal to rs[i], break the loop (page is already in memory).
If k == f (page is not in memory):
Set m[count] to rs[i] (replace the oldest page).
Increment count.
Increment pf (page fault counter).
Loop from j = 0 to j < f:
Print the current page in frame m[j].
If k == f:
Print "PF No. " followed by pf.
Print a newline.
If count == f, set count to 0 (reset the counter to start from the first frame again).
Print the Total Number of Page Faults:

Print "The number of Page Faults using FIFO are " followed by pf.
End

Here is the detailed step-by-step algorithm:

Start
Initialize Variables:
Declare int i, j, k, f, pf = 0, count = 0, rs[25], m[10], n.
Prompt User for Length of Reference String:
Print "Enter the length of reference string --".

Prompt User for Reference String:
Print "Enter the reference string --".
For i from 0 to n-1:
Read rs[i].
Prompt User for Number of Frames:
Print "Enter no. of frames --".
Read f.
Initialize Frames:
For i from 0 to f-1:
Set m[i] to -1.
Print Header:
Print "The Page Replacement Process is --".
Process Each Page Reference:
For i from 0 to n-1:
For k from 0 to f-1:
If m[k] == rs[i], break.
If k == f:
Set m[count] = rs[i].
Increment count.
Increment pf.
For j from 0 to f-1:
Print m[j].
If k == f, print "PF No. " followed by pf.
Print a newline.
If count == f, set count to 0.
Print Total Number of Page Faults:
Print "The number of Page Faults using FIFO are " followed by pf.

        }
        if (k == f) {
            m[count++] = rs[i];
            pf++;
        }

            count = 0;
    }
    printf("\nThe number of Page Faults using FIFO are %d\n", pf);
}
This code reads the reference string and the number of frames, then processes each page reference according to the FIFO page replacement algorithm, keeping track of page faults and printing the state of memory after each reference.

The provided code implements the Least Recently Used (LRU) page replacement algorithm. Here is a detailed explanation of the algorithm, followed by a corrected and properly formatted version of the code.

Algorithm Explanation:
Initialize Variables:

i, j, k: Loop counters.
f: Number of frames.
pf: Page fault counter, initialized to 0.
n: Length of the reference string.
rs[25]: Array to store the reference string (maximum 25 references).
m[10]: Array to store the pages in memory (maximum 10 frames).
index[10]: Array to store the time stamp (index) of when each frame was last used.
least: Variable to find the least recently used frame.
Input the Length of the Reference String:

Print "Enter the length of reference string -- ".
Read the integer n from the user input.
Input the Reference String:

Print "Enter the reference string -- ".
Loop from i = 0 to i < n:
Read the next page reference and store it in rs[i].
Input the Number of Frames:

Print "Enter no. of frames -- ".
Read the integer f from the user input.
Initialize the Frames and Indices:

Loop from i = 0 to i < f:
Set m[i] to -1 (indicating an empty frame).
Set index[i] to 0.
Print the Page Replacement Process Header:

Print "The Page Replacement Process is --".
Process Each Page Reference:

Loop from i = 0 to i < n:
Loop from k = 0 to k < f:
If m[k] is equal to rs[i], break the loop (page is already in memory).
Update index[k] to i + 1 to record the current time.
If k == f (page is not in memory):
Find the least recently used page by looping through index[].
Set least to the index of the least recently used frame.
Replace the page in m[least] with rs[i].
Update index[least] to i + 1.
Increment pf (page fault counter).
Print the current state of the memory frames.
If k == f, print "PF No. " followed by pf.
Print the Total Number of Page Faults:

Print "The number of Page Faults using LRU are " followed by pf.

This code reads the reference string and the number of frames, processes each page reference according to the LRU page replacement algorithm, keeps track of page faults, and prints the state of memory and page faults after each reference. The page fault counter pf is incremented each time a page replacement occurs, and the index[] array is used to track the last time each frame was used.

The provided code implements the Least Frequently Used (LFU) page replacement algorithm. This algorithm replaces the page that has been used the least frequently when a page fault occurs. Here's a detailed explanation of the algorithm and the corrected code:

Algorithm Explanation:
Initialize Variables:

rs[50]: Array to store the reference string (maximum 50 references).
i, j, k: Loop counters.
m: Length of the reference string.
f: Number of frames.
cntr[20]: Array to count the frequency of pages in frames (maximum 20 frames).
a[20]: Array to store the pages in memory frames.
min: Variable to find the frame with the least frequency.
pf: Page fault counter, initialized to 0.
flag: Variable to indicate if a page is already in memory.
Input the Length of the Reference String:

Print "Enter number of page references --".
Read the integer m from the user input.
Input the Reference String:

Print "Enter the reference string --".
Loop from i = 0 to i < m:
Read the next page reference and store it in rs[i].
Input the Number of Frames:

Print "Enter the available number of frames --".
Read the integer f from the user input.
Initialize the Frames and Counters:

Loop from i = 0 to i < f:
Set cntr[i] to 0 (indicating zero frequency).
Set a[i] to -1 (indicating an empty frame).
Print the Page Replacement Process Header:

Print "The Page Replacement Process is --".
Process Each Page Reference:

Loop from i = 0 to i < m:
Set flag to 0.
Loop from j = 0 to j < f:
If rs[i] is equal to a[j]:
Increment cntr[j].
Set flag to 1 (page is already in memory).
Break the loop.
If flag is 0 (page is not in memory):
Set min to 0.
Loop from k = 1 to k < f:
If cntr[k] is less than cntr[min], set min to k.
Replace the page in a[min] with rs[i].
Set cntr[min] to 1.
Increment pf (page fault counter).
Loop from j = 0 to j < f:
If a[j] is not -1, print a[j].
Else, print "-".
If flag is 0, print "PF No. " followed by pf.
Print a newline.
Print the Total Number of Page Faults:

Print "Total number of page faults --" followed by pf.

        printf("\n");
    }

    printf("\n\nTotal number of page faults -- %d\n", pf);

    return 0;
}
Explanation of the Corrected Code:
The code reads the number of page references, the reference string, and the number of available frames from the user.
It initializes the frame counters and the memory frames.
It processes each page reference, checking if the page is already in memory and updating the frequency counters.
If a page fault occurs, it replaces the least frequently used page and updates the counters and page fault count.
The code prints the state of the memory frames and the page fault number after each reference.
Finally, it prints the total number of page faults.

Here's the algorithm for the given code that implements the Banker's algorithm, followed by a review of the code's correctness.

Banker's Algorithm for Deadlock Avoidance
Initialize Variables:

n: Number of processes.
m: Number of resource types.
alloc[n][m]: Allocation matrix representing the resources currently allocated to each process.
max[n][m]: Maximum demand matrix representing the maximum resources each process may need.
avail[m]: Available vector representing the available instances of each resource type.
need[n][m]: Need matrix representing the remaining resource need of each process.
work[m]: Work vector used to simulate resource allocation.
finish[n]: Finish vector to indicate whether a process has finished executing.
safeseq[n]: Safe sequence of processes.
Input Data:

Read the number of processes n.
Read the number of resources m.
Read the allocation matrix alloc[n][m].
Read the maximum matrix max[n][m].
Read the available vector avail[m].
Calculate the Need Matrix:

need[i][j] = max[i][j] - alloc[i][j] for all processes i and resources j.
Initialize Work and Finish:

work[m] = avail[m].
finish[i] = 0 for all processes i.
Find a Safe Sequence:

Loop through all processes:
If finish[i] == 0 (process i has not finished):
Check if need[i][j] <= work[j] for all resources j.
If true:
Add alloc[i][j] to work[j] for all resources j.
Mark process i as finished (finish[i] = 1).
Add process i to the safe sequence.
Print the Safe Sequence:

Print the safe sequence safeseq.

    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("P%d ", safeseq[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}
Verification of Correctness:
Input Reading: The code reads the number of processes and resources, and then reads the allocation, maximum, and available matrices correctly.
Need Calculation: The need matrix is correctly calculated as need[i][j] = max[i][j] - alloc[i][j].
Safety Check: The code iterates over the processes, checking if their needs can be satisfied with the current work vector, and updates the work vector and finish status correctly.
Safe Sequence: The safe sequence is correctly stored in the safeseq array and printed.
Potential Issues:
The code assumes that there will always be a safe sequence, which may not be true for all input cases.
If no safe sequence exists, the code does not handle that scenario explicitly.
To improve the code, consider adding a check for deadlock detection by verifying if the safe sequence array is fully populated at the end.

Certainly! Here's an algorithmic representation of the producer-consumer problem implemented in the given C code:

Producer-Consumer Problem Algorithm
Variables:
mutex: A binary semaphore to ensure mutual exclusion.
full: Counts the number of items in the buffer.
empty: Counts the number of empty slots in the buffer.
x: Represents the shared buffer item.
Functions:
Producer Function (producer()):

Decrements mutex (entering critical section).
Increments full (indicating a new item is produced).
Decrements empty (since an empty slot is filled).
Produces an item (x++).
Prints the produced item.
Increments mutex (leaving critical section).
Consumer Function (consumer()):

Decrements mutex (entering critical section).
Decrements full (indicating an item is consumed).
Increments empty (since an empty slot is freed).
Consumes an item (x--).
Prints the consumed item.
Increments mutex (leaving critical section).
Main Function (main()):
Initializes mutex to 1, full to 0, empty to 5, and x to 0.
Prints the options for user interaction.
Enters a loop to continuously accept user input.
Based on the user's choice:
Calls producer() if the buffer is not full.
Calls consumer() if the buffer is not empty.
Exits the program if the user chooses to exit.

            case 3:
                exit program
                break
Explanation:
Mutex: Ensures that only one process (producer or consumer) accesses the shared buffer at a time, preventing race conditions.
Full and Empty: Counters to track the number of items in the buffer (full) and the number of available slots (empty).
Producer Function: Adds an item to the buffer if there's space (empty > 0).
Consumer Function: Removes an item from the buffer if there's an item (full > 0).
Main Function: Controls the flow of the program based on user input, allowing the user to produce items, consume items, or exit the program.
This algorithm ensures that the producer and consumer operations are synchronized using mutex and properly handle buffer overflows (Buffer is full) and underflows (Buffer is empty).

a simple Program to write data into shared memory segment in c using os concept 
ChatGPT
Certainly! Writing data into a shared memory segment in C involves several steps, primarily creating or obtaining a shared memory segment, attaching to it, and then writing data into it. Here's a simplified example program that demonstrates these steps:

Example Program: Writing Data into Shared Memory in C
c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/ipc.h>
#include <sys/shm.h>
#include <string.h>

#define SHM_SIZE 1024  // Size of the shared memory segment

int main() {
    int shm_id;       // Shared memory segment ID
    char *shm_addr;   // Pointer to the shared memory segment
    key_t key = 1234; // Key for the shared memory segment

    // Create the shared memory segment
    shm_id = shmget(key, SHM_SIZE, IPC_CREAT | 0666);
    if (shm_id < 0) {
        perror("shmget");
        exit(1);
    }

    // Attach to the shared memory segment
    shm_addr = shmat(shm_id, NULL, 0);
    if (shm_addr == (char *) -1) {
        perror("shmat");
        exit(1);
    }

    // Write data into the shared memory segment
    printf("Writing data into shared memory: ");
    strcpy(shm_addr, "Hello, Shared Memory!");

    printf("Data written: %s\n", shm_addr);

    // Detach from the shared memory segment
    if (shmdt(shm_addr) == -1) {
        perror("shmdt");
        exit(1);
    }

    return 0;
}
Explanation:
Headers:

#include <stdio.h>: Standard input-output functions.
#include <stdlib.h>: Standard library functions like exit().
#include <unistd.h>: POSIX API functions, including getpid() and fork().
#include <sys/ipc.h>: Definitions for interprocess communication using keys.
#include <sys/shm.h>: Definitions for shared memory operations.
Constants:

SHM_SIZE: Size of the shared memory segment in bytes.
Main Function:

Key Definition: key_t key = 1234; specifies the key used to identify the shared memory segment.

Creating Shared Memory Segment:

c
Copy code
shm_id = shmget(key, SHM_SIZE, IPC_CREAT | 0666);
shmget() creates or opens a shared memory segment. Here, IPC_CREAT flag is used to create the segment if it does not exist, and 0666 sets the permissions to read and write for all users.
Attaching to Shared Memory:

c
Copy code
shm_addr = shmat(shm_id, NULL, 0);
shmat() attaches to the shared memory segment identified by shm_id. shm_addr is the address where the shared memory is attached.
Writing Data:

c
Copy code
strcpy(shm_addr, "Hello, Shared Memory!");
Writes the string "Hello, Shared Memory!" into the shared memory segment pointed to by shm_addr.
Detaching from Shared Memory:

c
Copy code
if (shmdt(shm_addr) == -1) {
    perror("shmdt");
    exit(1);
}
shmdt() detaches from the shared memory segment.
Error Handling:

Error checks are performed after each critical operation (shmget, shmat, shmdt) to handle any failures.
Running the Program:
Compile the program using gcc:
Copy code
gcc -o write_shared_memory write_shared_memory.c
Run the executable:
bash
Copy code
./write_shared_memory
Notes:
Ensure that the key used (1234 in this example) is unique and known to processes that need to access the shared memory segment.
Shared memory operations require careful synchronization and mutual exclusion mechanisms to avoid race conditions when accessed by multiple processes concurrently.
This example demonstrates basic usage; in practical scenarios, error handling, synchronization, and data structure design are crucial considerations.

Certainly! Here's a simplified version of a C program that writes data into a shared memory segment:

c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#include <sys/ipc.h>
#include <sys/shm.h>

#define SHM_SIZE 1024  // Size of the shared memory segment

int main() {
    int shm_id;
    char *shm_addr;
    key_t key = 1234; // Key for the shared memory segment

    // Create or open the shared memory segment
    shm_id = shmget(key, SHM_SIZE, IPC_CREAT | 0666);
    if (shm_id == -1) {
        perror("shmget");
        exit(1);
    }

    // Attach to the shared memory segment
    shm_addr = shmat(shm_id, NULL, 0);
    if (shm_addr == (char *) -1) {
        perror("shmat");
        exit(1);
    }

    // Write data into shared memory
    strcpy(shm_addr, "Hello, Shared Memory!");

    printf("Data written into shared memory: %s\n", shm_addr);

    // Detach from the shared memory segment
    if (shmdt(shm_addr) == -1) {
        perror("shmdt");
        exit(1);
    }

    return 0;
}
Explanation:
Headers: Include necessary headers for standard I/O, memory management, IPC (interprocess communication), and shared memory operations.

Constants: Define SHM_SIZE to specify the size of the shared memory segment.

Main Function:

Shared Memory Creation:

c
Copy code
shm_id = shmget(key, SHM_SIZE, IPC_CREAT | 0666);
shmget() creates or opens a shared memory segment identified by key. The IPC_CREAT flag is used to create the segment if it does not exist.
Attaching to Shared Memory:

c
Copy code
shm_addr = shmat(shm_id, NULL, 0);
shmat() attaches to the shared memory segment identified by shm_id. shm_addr is the address where the shared memory is attached.
Writing Data:

c
Copy code
strcpy(shm_addr, "Hello, Shared Memory!");
Copies the string "Hello, Shared Memory!" into the shared memory segment pointed to by shm_addr.
Detaching from Shared Memory:

c
Copy code
if (shmdt(shm_addr) == -1) {
    perror("shmdt");
    exit(1);
}
shmdt() detaches from the shared memory segment.
Error Handling: Checks return values of shmget, shmat, and shmdt for errors using perror() and exits with an error code if there's a failure.

Running the Program:
Compile and run the program similarly to the previous instructions:
bash
Copy code
gcc -o write_shared_memory write_shared_memory.c
./write_shared_memory
Notes:
This example provides a basic framework for writing data into shared memory. Ensure proper synchronization and error handling in real-world applications.
Shared memory operations should be used carefully to prevent data corruption or unintended behavior when accessed by multiple processes simultaneously.

    return 0;
}
Explanation:
Headers: Include necessary headers for standard I/O, memory management, IPC (interprocess communication), and shared memory operations.

Constants: Define SHM_SIZE to specify the size of the shared memory segment.

Main Function:

Shared Memory Access:

c
Copy code
shm_id = shmget(key, SHM_SIZE, 0666);
shmget() opens the existing shared memory segment identified by key and SHM_SIZE.
Attaching to Shared Memory:

c
Copy code
shm_addr = shmat(shm_id, NULL, 0);
shmat() attaches to the shared memory segment identified by shm_id. shm_addr is the address where the shared memory is attached.

Notes:
Ensure that the key used (1234 in this example) matches the key used in the program that writes data into the shared memory segment.
Proper synchronization and error handling are essential in real-world applications involving shared memory to avoid data corruption or unintended behavior.
Optionally, you can remove the shared memory segment after use using shmctl(shm_id, IPC_RMID, NULL); if it's no longer needed.

}
Explanation and Corrections:
Include Directives: Moved the #include directives to be on separate lines for clarity.

Main Function:

Writing Program:

Uses fgets() to read input from the user, which is safer than read() for handling input buffers.
Uses strcpy() to copy the input buffer (buff) into the shared memory segment (shared_memory).
Reading Program:

Directly prints the data read from the shared memory segment.
Error Handling: Added error checks after critical operations (shmget, shmat, shmdt) to ensure robustness.

Detaching: Added shmdt to detach from the shared memory segment after reading or writing.

Return Type: Changed void main() to int main() as it's more standard to return an int from main() in C.

Running the Programs:
Compile and run each program separately. For example:

bash
Copy code
gcc -o write_shared_memory write_shared_memory.c
./write_shared_memory
Ensure to run the writing program (write_shared_memory) first to write data into shared memory before running the reading program (read_shared_memory) to read the data.

Notes:
Shared memory operations must be synchronized properly when used across multiple processes.
Ensure that the key (2345 in this example) matches between programs that share the same segment.
Handle input and output operations carefully to avoid buffer overflows or data loss.
create algorithm for these codes separately 
ChatGPT
Sure, let's create algorithms for each of the provided C programs separately. Algorithms are step-by-step instructions that outline the actions and logic performed by the programs.

Algorithm for Program to Write Data into Shared Memory Segment
Include necessary headers: stdio.h, stdlib.h, unistd.h, sys/shm.h, string.h.

Define variables:

void *shared_memory: Pointer to the shared memory segment.
char buff[100]: Buffer to store user input.
int shmid: Shared memory segment identifier.
Create or open shared memory segment:

Use shmget() to create or open a shared memory segment identified by key 2345 with a size of 1024 bytes.
Check for errors (shmid == -1).
Attach to the shared memory segment:

Use shmat() to attach to the shared memory segment identified by shmid.
Check for errors (shared_memory == (void *) -1).
Prompt user for input:

Display a prompt to the user to enter data.
Use fgets() to read up to 100 characters of input from standard input (stdin) into buff.
Write data into shared memory:

Use strcpy() to copy the contents of buff into shared_memory.
Display confirmation:

Print the data written into shared memory.
Detach from shared memory segment:

Use shmdt() to detach from shared_memory.
Check for errors (shmdt() returns -1 on failure).
End of program:

Terminate the program.

Use shmat() to attach to the shared memory segment identified by shmid.
Check for errors (shared_memory == (void *) -1).
Read data from shared memory:

Print the contents of shared_memory.
Detach from shared memory segment:

Use shmdt() to detach from shared_memory.
Check for errors (shmdt() returns -1 on failure).
End of program:

Terminate the program.
Notes:
Both programs use shared memory operations (shmget(), shmat(), shmdt()) to interact with a shared memory segment identified by key 2345.
Proper error handling (shmget() failure, shmat() failure, shmdt() failure) is implemented to ensure robustness.
Input/output operations (fgets(), printf()) are used for interacting with the user and displaying results.
These algorithms outline the essential steps and logic flow of each program, focusing on interaction with shared memory and basic error handling.
